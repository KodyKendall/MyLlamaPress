# Our Vision

LLamaPress is designed for everyone‚Äîfrom the least technical to the most technical user. Our mission is to democratize software development, making it accessible to all.

### üå± Origin Story

LLamaPress was born out of necessity. At our SaaS startup/agency, we faced a common problem: users constantly needed new features and customizations. Each business had unique needs, making support expensive and complex.

To solve this, we integrated a chatbot to assist our free tier of users. As we built LLMs into the chatbot, we realized something incredible: the bot was surprisingly effective, particularly because the underlying code was built on Ruby on Rails. That was our "aha" moment, and LLamaPress was born.

### üèÅ Current State of Affairs:

We're currently using LLamaPress to build our SaaS and marketing agency, while helping new users build their own software on the platform. Join us on this journey to reshape the future of software development!

---

We‚Äôre excited to see what you‚Äôll create with LLamaPress. Welcome aboard!

# üöÄ Getting Started

### Install `mise`

We use `mise` to manage our tools.

Installation instructions: https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html

Once installed just run `mise install` from the root of the project.
